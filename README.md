[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2a8e849f-8415-4683-a6f7-06f4ff473049/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/patchwork-archive/deploys)

Frontend for Patchwork Archive, an archival project for VTuber music.

## Deploy Locally
```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
Designed to work with [Patchwork-Backend](https://github.com/Patchwork-Archive/Patchwork-Backend) but so long as your API reports information in the same format, this frontend can be used to serve any subset of content.

**Note that this repository does not contain any archival tools or code for the backend**
